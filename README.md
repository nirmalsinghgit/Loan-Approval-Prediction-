Loan approval involves lots of tedious processes where a lender (Bank Employee) have to look at Various Information about the Applicant and then decide Whether to Approve Application or not.

This can b depended on the past experience of Bank on parameters such as credit Score ,LifeStyle etc.

Therefore this problem can be tackled via Machine Learning Algorithms While making process fast and at the same time overcoming Human bias in decision making .

Here in this JupyterNotebook Above .I tried to adress the Problem using Various Machine Learning Algoithms.
